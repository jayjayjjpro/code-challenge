# Market Module

## Overview

The Market Module is a core component of our dApp, enabling the creation, storage, and retrieval of financial market details on our blockchain.

## Features

- **Market Creation:** Allows users to create new financial markets with specific attributes and data.
- **Market Storage:** Securely stores all the details of the financial markets on-chain.
- **Market Retrieval:** Provides efficient ways to retrieve specific market data or details.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started with the Market Module, ensure you have the following software tools installed:

### Docker

Docker is instrumental for our exercises and deployments.

- **Installation:** Head to the [Install Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/get-started) page.
- **Learning:** If Docker is unfamiliar, consider this [quick introduction](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

### Go

Go is vital for developing with the Cosmos SDK.

- **Installation:** Visit the [Go download and install](https://golang.org/doc/install) page. The latest version is recommended.

### Node.js

Node.js is necessary for development with CosmJS.

- **Installation:** Install from the [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page. Opt for the latest version.

### Rust

Some components are built with Rust.

- **Installation:** Follow the guide on the [Rust Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) page.
- **Version Check:** Use `rustc --version`.
- **Update:** If you've installed Rust before, update with `rustup update`.
- **Test Installation:** Verify with `cargo version`.

### Visual Studio Code

VS Code is recommended for both Cosmos SDK and CosmJS.

- **Installation:** Get it from the [Visual Studio Code install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) page. Choose the version suitable for your operating system.

> **Note:** For organizational clarity, create a dedicated project folder for all your Cosmos exercises.

## Quickstart

1.  Clone the repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Switcheo/code-challenge.git
```
2. Before working with the Market Module, ensure your environment is properly set up. If you're new to Cosmos SDK, you might want to refer to the [official documentation](https://cosmos.network/) for guidance.
3. Initializing the Market Module
```shell
<your-binary-name> init <your-node-name> --chain-id=<your-chain-id>
```
4. Configuration: Ensure the configuration is set correctly for your network. Edit the ~/.<your-binary-name>/config/config.toml and ~/.<your-binary-name>/config/app.toml files if needed.
5. Refer to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) to create a market
6. Further Exploration: Dive deeper into the module's functionality by referring to the comprehensive Module Documentation.

## Testing

Guidelines on how to test the Market Module:

1. Setting up the test environment.
2. Running unit tests.
3. Running integration tests.
4. Expected outcomes and potential pitfalls.

## Areas of Improvement

#### Shortcoming 1: Input Validation

Only the expiry time argument is validated for correct format. The other arguments (e.g., market type, base, quote, etc.) aren't checked for validity in the CLI command.

For example, for txMarket.go
```go
return errorsmod.Wrapf(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "invalid expiry time: %s", err)

```
**Improvements**
```go
if len(argsMarketType) == 0 || len(argsBase) == 0 || len(argsQuote) == 0 {
    return sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "market type, base or quote cannot be empty")
}

```
#### Shortcoming 2: Flag Setting

No validation for transaction flags.

The flags.AddTxFlagsToCmd(cmd) method adds transaction flags to the command, but there's no check if these flags are correctly provided by the user or if they are valid.

For example, for txMarket.go
```go
flags.AddTxFlagsToCmd(cmd)

```

**Improvements**

Provide validation for transaction flags to ensure they are correctly set and give feedback on any missing or invalid flags.
```go
// After calling flags.AddTxFlagsToCmd(cmd)

if !cmd.Flags().Changed("from") {
    return sdkerrors.Wrap(sdkerrors.ErrInvalidRequest, "the 'from' flag is required")
}

```
#### Shortcoming 3: Documentations
No detailed argument descriptions

There's a short description provided, but detailed documentation about each argument's expected format and values is missing.

**Improvements**

Enhance the documentation to provide more context on each argument. This would assist users in understanding how to use the command correctly.

```go
cmd := &cobra.Command{
    // ... other properties
    Long: `
This command is used to create a market with the following arguments:

- market-type: The type of market being created.
- base: The base asset.
- quote: The quote asset.
- base-usd-price: Current USD price of the base asset.
- quote-usd-price: Current USD price of the quote asset.
- index-oracle-id: The ID of the oracle that provides the index.
- expiry-time: Expiry time for the market in Unix timestamp format.
`,
}

```

#### Shortcoming 4: Error Feedback
Errors are directly returned without additional contextual information. While this is generally fine for developers, it might not be user-friendly for end users who might benefit from more descriptive error messages.

For example for queryMarket.go

**Improvements**

Wrap errors with descriptive messages to provide better feedback. For example:
```go
// Instead of:
// return err

// Use:
return fmt.Errorf("failed to query all markets: %w", err)


```

#### Shortcoming 5: CLI Command Naming
The 'CmdShowMarket' command uses market as its name. While this is descriptive, it might be more intuitive to use verbs like get or show for querying commands.

For example for queryMarket.go

```go
cmd := &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "market [name]",
    ...
}

```

**Improvements**

Consider renaming the command to something like get-market or show-market for clarity.

```go
cmd := &cobra.Command{
    Use:   "get-market [name]",
    ...
}

```
