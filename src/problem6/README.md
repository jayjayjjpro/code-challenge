## Prerequisites

Before you get started with the Market Module, ensure you have the following software tools installed:

### Docker

Docker is instrumental for our exercises and deployments.

- **Installation:** Head to the [Install Docker Engine](https://www.docker.com/get-started) page.
- **Learning:** If Docker is unfamiliar, consider this [quick introduction](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/).

### Go

Go is vital for developing with the Cosmos SDK.

- **Installation:** Visit the [Go download and install](https://golang.org/doc/install) page. The latest version is recommended.

### Node.js

Node.js is necessary for development with CosmJS.

- **Installation:** Install from the [Node.js download](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) page. Opt for the latest version.

### Rust

Some components are built with Rust.

- **Installation:** Follow the guide on the [Rust Install](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) page.
- **Version Check:** Use `rustc --version`.
- **Update:** If you've installed Rust before, update with `rustup update`.
- **Test Installation:** Verify with `cargo version`.

### Visual Studio Code

VS Code is recommended for both Cosmos SDK and CosmJS.

- **Installation:** Get it from the [Visual Studio Code install](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) page. Choose the version suitable for your operating system.

> **Note:** For organizational clarity, create a dedicated project folder for all your Cosmos exercises.
